    \begin{itemize}
        \item[\faGraduationCap] 
            \textbf{University:} Bachelor's degree in 
            \textit{Computer Science} at 
            the University of Naples Federico ll obtained in March 2025, with a grade of 110+/110 (graduated with honors).
            
        \item[\faBook] 
            \textbf{High school:} Got my high school 
            diploma in 2021 at Liceo Scientifico 
            Statale "Elio Vittorini" in Naples.

\NewPart{Projects}{}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\cpp] 
        \textbf{Basalt:} A compiler for 
        my own low-level type-safe programming 
        language with full support for generics, 
        type-inference and pseudo-polymorphism. The 
        compiler uses LLVM as a backend to generate 
        machine code for most modern architectures, 
        generating object files compatible with most 
        modern linkers.

    \item[\squigarr] 
        From this project I learned how to 
        manage complexity in a large codebase
        and how to design for maintainability
        in the long run. I also learned how to
        manage tasks and deadlines in a large
        project and how to respond to unforeseen 
        difficulties.

    \item[\java] 
        \textbf{DietiDeals24:} A dummy e-commerce webapp with Java Spring Boot backend, 
        with JWT-based authentication, Redis integration for caching and session management,
        and a PostgreSQL database for storing products and orders. Developed locally with 
        Docker-compose and released on AWS and integrated with Google OAuth 2.0. It also supports 
        OpenAPI (Swagger) for self documentation.

    \item[\squigarr] 
        From this project I learned how to work with the cloud, and most importantly how 
        REST APIs work, how the codebase lifecycle of a web-based backend works and how 
        to use state of the art tools and technologies to build modern and scalable backends.

    \item[\faPython] 
        \textbf{IssuuDownloader:} A command-line utility 
        to download PDFs from Issuu.com in bulk. It 
        uses multiple threads to download files in
        parallel and it can be used to download
        entire collections of documents in one go. It 
        is also able to resume downloads from where
        they left off using a cache file.

    \item[\squigarr] 
        From this project I learned how to 
        understand and reverse-engineer network
        protocols and non-documented APIs. I also 
        learned how to use threads in python and how 
        to take advantage of parallelism to speed up
        I/O-bound tasks.

    \item[\faPython] 
        \textbf{BackproPy:} A simple and beginner-friendly
        explanatory implementation of the back-propagation
        algorithm for neural networks in Python. It takes 
        inspiration from "minigrad" by Andrej
        Karpathy and it is designed to improve it by making 
        it less error-prone and more readable. 

    \item[\squigarr] 
        From this project I learned how 
        the back-propagation algorithm works and how to
        use it to train simple neural networks.
